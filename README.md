## Setup

### Building components

```bash
# Clone the repo.

git clone git@github.com:polwex/kinode.git

# Configure dependency retrieval from GitHub
mkdir .cargo
echo "net.git-fetch-with-cli = true" > .cargo/config

# Get some stuff so we can build Wasm.

cd kinode
nix develop

# Build the runtime, along with a number of booted-at-startup WASM modules including terminal and key_value
# OPTIONAL: --release flag

cargo build --release
```

### Boot
Get an eth-sepolia-rpc API key and pass that as an argument. You can get one for free at `alchemy.com`.

Make sure not to use the same home directory for two nodes at once! You can use any name for the home directory: here we just use `home`. The `--` here separates cargo arguments from binary arguments.

TODO: document feature flags `--simulation-mode`
```bash
sh boot.sh <your-api-key>
```
or 
```bash
cat <your-keyfile> | xargs ./boot
```

On boot you will be prompted to navigate to `localhost:8080`. Make sure your ETH wallet is connected to the Sepolia test network. Login should be straightforward, just submit the transactions and follow the flow. If you want to register a new ID you will either need [Sepolia testnet tokens](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia) or an invite code.

### Distro and Runtime processes

The base OS install comes with certain runtime modules. These are interacted with in the same way as userspace processes, but are deeply ingrained to the system and the APIs they present at their Process IDs are assumed to be available by userspace processes. All of these are identified in the `distro:sys` package.

This distribution of the OS also comes with userspace packages pre-installed. Some of these packages are intimately tied to the runtime: `terminal`, `homepage`, and `kns_indexer`. Modifying, removing or replacing the distro userspace packages should only be done in highly specialized use-cases.

The runtime distro processes are:

- `eth:distro:sys`
- `http_client:distro:sys`
- `http_server:distro:sys`
- `kernel:distro:sys`
- `kv:distro:sys`
- `net:distro:sys`
- `state:distro:sys`
- `terminal:distro:sys`
- `timer:distro:sys`
- `sqlite:distro:sys`
- `vfs:distro:sys`

The distro userspace packages are:

- `app_store:sys`
- `chess:sys`
- `homepage:sys`
- `kns_indexer:sys`
- `terminal:sys`
- `tester:sys` (only installed in if compiled with feature flag `simulation-mode`)

The `sys` publisher is not a real node ID, but it's also not a special case value. Packages, whether runtime or userspace, installed from disk when a node bootstraps do not have their package ID or publisher node ID validated. Packages installed (not injected locally, as is done during development) after a node has booted will have their publisher field validated.

### Terminal syntax

- CTRL+C or CTRL+D to gracefully shutdown node
- CTRL+V to toggle through verbose modes (0-3, 0 is default and lowest verbosity)

- CTRL+J to toggle debug mode
- CTRL+S to step through events in debug mode

- CTRL+L to toggle logging mode, which writes all terminal output to the `.terminal_log` file. Off by default, this will write all events and verbose prints with timestamps.

- CTRL+A to jump to beginning of input
- CTRL+E to jump to end of input
- UpArrow/DownArrow or CTRL+P/CTRL+N to move up and down through command history
- CTRL+R to search history, CTRL+R again to toggle through search results, CTRL+G to cancel search

- `/message <address> <json>`: send an inter-process message. <address> is formatted as <node>@<process_id>. <process_id> is formatted as <process_name>:<package_name>:<publisher_node>.
    - Example: `/message our@net:distro:sys diagnostics`
    - `our` will always be interpolated by the system as your node's name
    - Can also use `/m` for same command: `/m our@net:distro:sys diagnostics`
- `/app <address>`: set the terminal to a mode where all messages go to a specific app. To clear this selection, use `/app clear` or simply `/app`. This is useful for apps that have a command line interface.
    - Example: `/app our@net:distro:sys`, then `/m diagnostics`
    - Can also use `/a` for same command: `/a our@net:distro:sys`
    - Example of sending many messages:
        - `/a ben.os@net:distro:sys`
        - `/m hey there`
        - `/m how are you?`
        - `/a` (to exit app mode)
- `/hi <name> <string>`: send a text message to another node's command line.
    - Example: `/hi ben.os hello world`
- `/top <process_id>`: display kernel debugging info about a process. Leave the process ID blank to display info about all processes and get the total number of running processes.
    - Example: `/top net:distro:sys`
    - Example: `/top`

### Terminal example usage

Download and install an app:
```
/m our@main:app_store:sys {"Download": {"package": {"package_name": "<pkg>", "publisher_node": "<node>"}, "install_from": "<node>"}}
/m our@main:app_store:sys {"Install": {"package_name": "<pkg>", "publisher_node": "<node>"}}
```
